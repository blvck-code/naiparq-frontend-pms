Established in\n        2021, our main goal has been to solve the parking problem in cities. The\n        surge in parking demand has led to mounting pressure to expand the\n        supply of parking infrastructure through the conversion of unused land\n        into private parking spaces, and the construction of multi-level\n        parking facilities within buildings.\n        A parking facility has the potential to generate revenue for its\n        proprietor, while simultaneously providing motorists with the advantages\n        of convenience, Pay-as-you-Go pricing, and security. We address the\n        parking predicament by catering to the requirements of both ends of the\n        spectrum, namely parking facility owners and motorists.\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Who is NaiparQ?\n        \n        \n          Naiparq is an award-winning technology innovator in\n          emerging markets. Our team has a strong background in building systems\n          and software both as a stand-alone system or/and integrating into your\n          existing systems. Our key strength is innovation. We are based in\n          Nairobi; Kenya and we are in the business of improving the\n          efficiencies of our customers. We offer locally developed,\n          customizable solutions (African solutions for the African market).\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        How we solve your Parking Problems\n      \n      We currently have two solutions:\n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            We are the airbnb of parking for parking – where\n            motorists can reserve a parking space in advance. We look at a\n            parking space as a form of real estate that can be ‘rented’ and can\n            generate revenue for the owner. This solution works to open up\n            underutilized spaces in the city by empowering everyone and anyone\n            with idle parking space or even idle land to list and advertise\n            their spaces on the Naiparq platform. The process is simple, a\n            parking space owner would list his/her spaces on the Naiparq\n            platform while a motorist would download the Naiparq mobile app on\n            their phone and use it to find and reserve this space.\n          \n        \n        \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Our parking management solution incorporates access control features\n            and employs License Plate Recognition (LPR) software to automate the\n            parking process, augment facility security, and minimize the risk of\n            unauthorized access. This comprehensive system is capable of\n            managing both commercial parking lots, which require payment for\n            parking, as well as non-commercial parking lots, such as those found\n            at office blocks or residential areas, where parking is free of\n            charge.

Established in        2021, our main goal has been to solve the parking problem in cities. The        surge in parking demand has led to mounting pressure to expand the        supply of parking infrastructure through the conversion of unused land        into private parking spaces, and the construction of multi-level        parking facilities within buildings.        A parking facility has the potential to generate revenue for its        proprietor, while simultaneously providing motorists with the advantages        of convenience, Pay-as-you-Go pricing, and security. We address the        parking predicament by catering to the requirements of both ends of the        spectrum, namely parking facility owners and motorists.

installing Node 16 Long Term Support Edition(LTE)\nTo easily switch between node versions on your machine, we recommend using a node virtual environment tool such as nave or nvm-windows, depending on your operating system.\nFor example, here is how you switch to a new node version using nave:\n# note that you don't even need to update your node version before installing nave\nnpm install -g nave\n\nnave use 12.3.1\nnode -v\nv12.3.1Installing the Angular CLI\nWith the following command the angular-cli will be installed globally in your machine:\nnpm install -g @angular/cli How To install this repository\nWe can install the master branch using the following commands:\ngit clone http://192.168.0.207/naiparq/naiparq-frontend-pms.gitAfter cloning the repo, next you install npm on the project directory using the below commands on your terminal:\ncd naiparq-frontend-pms\nnpm install This should take a couple of minutes. If there are issues, try re-installing the node js again.\nTo run the Development UI Server\nTo run the frontend part of our code, we will use the Angular CLI:\nng serveThe application is visible at port 4200: http://localhost:4200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n
